		<string>Stage 3 _ Phase 4 _ Conditioning _ Rope Skipping _ Rope skipping is an excellent activity to build conditioning, footwork skills, co ordination, leg speed and power.&amp; Players might need to be taught the basics, and once mastered, there are countless drills and exercises to do!

Basic: To find a rope that fits, place one foot in the center of the rope and lift the handles - they shouldn&apos;t go past your armpits.
Jump 1 to 2 inches off floor, giving rope just enough space to slip under your feet. Only the balls of feet should touch the floor.
Keep elbows close to sides as you turn the rope.&amp; The movement comes from the wrists and forearms, not the shoulders.
Aim: One jump per loop, single step.</string>

		<string>Stage 3 _ Phase 4 _ Conditioning _ Repeat Run-a-3s _ A bit like suicide runs, but cricket-specific. Players run 3 runs the length of a cricket pitch.&amp; Their aim is to run as fast as they can, focusing on good turn mechanics.&amp; This is a repeat effort exercise of maximal intensity.

GIve players a target time in which to run the 3 runs in.&amp; For example, under 15 seconds.

Provide them with a period of rest to partially recover, but not completely, (no more than 30 seconds.)
Indicate the number of repetitions to complete.
6 reps of 3-Run-A-3&apos;s sub 15 seconds on a 30 second cycle.</string>

		<string>Stage 1 _ Phase 4 _ Conditioning Activity _ Rope Skipping _ Rope skipping is an excellent activity to build conditioning, footwork skills, co ordination, leg speed and power.&amp; Players might need to be taught the basics, and once mastered, there are countless drills and exercises to do!

Basic: To find a rope that fits, place one foot in the center of the rope and lift the handles - they shouldn&apos;t go past your armpits.&amp;
Jump 1 to 2 inches off floor, giving rope just enough space to slip under your feet. Only the balls of feet should touch the floor.&amp;
Keep elbows close to sides as you turn the rope.&amp; The movement comes from the wrists and forearms, not the shoulders.&amp;
Aim: One jump per loop, single step.</string>
